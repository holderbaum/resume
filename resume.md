# Profile of Jakob Holderbaum

As a Freelance Consultant, Coach and Developer, I help customers on site to
transform towards an agile approach to building working and secure Software and
Hardware. By working together with the existing product team, I can focus on
building capabilities in the team while collaborating on delivering value
continuously.

## I am an Agile Enthusiast.

I spend my time **continuously delivering** software and hardware systems using
**test-first methodologies**. Working in close collaboration with fellow
developers, designers, business analysts and product owners through **pairing**
and **on-site teamwork**.

## I am a Generalist.

Throughout the years I have faced challenges of product development in a
multitude of domains. I've developed **large scale mobile browser games**
entertaining millions of users. In addition to this I worked on a wide spectrum
of industry applications, from **security critical IoT platforms** to **safety
critical bootloaders for microcontrollers**.

## I am a Pragmatist.

I truly believe that picking the right tool for the job is much more valuable
than becoming a master of a single trade. Here is a a partial list of my
skills:

## My Services

As a Freelance Consultant, Coach and Software Developer I can help your team
and your product to become better in delivering working and secure software:

### Hands-On Consulting with a dynamic Focus

Hands-On Consulting usually happens on-site. I join the team as a fellow
developer and support them with delivering a working product. While working
together, I can identify different issues and pain points that can be leveraged
to improve various aspects of the process and the product being build. Through
methodologies like **pair programming** and **leading by example** I support
the team in establishing practices that will help them to grow even further. Here are my main areas of focus:

* Agile Methodologies: Pair Programming, Kanban, SCRUM, Retros, Stand-Up/Dailies, ...
* Delivery Performance: CI/CD, Trunk Based Development and Test Automation
* Architecture/Design Assessment: Let's see how we can even further improve existing systems by identifying pivotal pain points

### Security Consulting

Nearly all of the projects I have worked on so far were critical in regards of
their security. I can help your teams in delivering safer software by focusing
on security best practices throughout the entire product life cycle:

* Avoiding basic mistakes while developing software (e.g. secret management, ...)
* How to ensure running software is monitored
* Hardening server and cloud infrastructure beyond just the developer stack

### Legacy System Refactoring

Most companies I have worked with so far had their fair share of wildly grown
and mostly untested legacy systems that where still an integral part of their
infrastructure and products.

I have a lot of experience in incrementally converting an existing untested
legacy system into stable and maintainable software while staying in production
and continuing feature development.

### Coaching / Consulting for building Connected Heaters (2018/2019)

I joined the existing platform team in order to rebuild legacy infrastructure
in Azure with a focus on Infrastructure as Code and Continuous Integration.
While maintaining stacks like Elastic Search and Kafka I also worked closely
with other delivery teams to bring best practices into play (e.g. Pairing,
Trunk Based Development, DevOps Mindset).

### Founding of the Think About! Conference in Cologne, Germany (2018)

Together with two other people I bootstrapped a startup (HRX Veranstaltungen
GmbH) in early 2018 in order to carry out tech conferences in Cologne. Since
this date we are pushing to make the first Think About! Conference
([https://think-about.io/](https://think-about/)) happen on May 2019 in
Cologne.

### Coaching / Consulting for building Connected Battery Chargers (2018)

I joined a freshly formed client team with the sole focus of sustainably
building capabilities around agile methodologies and technological knowledge.
Together we developed an embedded software platform that is continuously built
and tested on the CI server running on AWS. All coaching was done through
pairing with different team members to deliver the expected quality on time.

### Consulting for a Smart Meter IoT Platform (2017/2018)

I joined a company with an already existing platform that connects Smart Meters
and provides value added services for the customers, like live data on mobile
phone apps. Scope of the engagement was further development to help with
scaling issues, user centered design and an intensified focus on platform
security -- through co-delivery development and workshops on site.  The team
was mixed between ThoughtWorks Consultants and full time employees.

### Building an IoT Platform for Connected Machines (2016/2017)

I designed and built an IoT Platform for connected machines. The project
consisted of development and maintenance of the embedded platform in the
connected machines, building a scalable cloud infrastructure to maintain the
connection to the vehicles and designing and delivering supportive software for
end users.

The embedded software is built fully Test Driven and based on FreeRTOS and C++.
The cloud infrastructure is hosted on AWS, completely defined in code using
Terraform and fully tested using Ruby. One focus of the development was the
definition in pure software combined with automated testing and continuous
deployment for the infrastructure.

The delivery itself was done with a mixed team of ThoughtWorkers and developers
of the client. This involved a lot of mentoring and coaching to shape the agile
way of working together towards an ambitious delivery goal.

### Building an App with Cloud Backend (2016)

I worked as a developing consultant with the client for several months on site.
The project consisted of a mobile HTML5 application written in React JS and a
Java/Spring backend that integrated with the Open Stack Cloud environment of
the clients infrastructure running Kubernetes.

The project consisted of two main focus points: Establishing a refined workkow
for the users of the application to replace the currently paper based process
and integration with the legacy CRM System and its SOAP Interfaces to provide a
consistent data representation and synchronization.  Technical concepts like
Docker Containerization, Continuous Integration & Release and XP Methodologies
like TDD and Pair Programming played a major role throughout the entire
development and maintenance efort.

Beside the technical delivery, the team also had an impact in shaping the clients workkow to help on the way towards a more agile approach to software delivery.

### Consulting for Automotive Microcontroller Bootloader Verification (2015)

The client I joined was pushing a new multicore automotive microcontroller to
market. A required part of the release was an automated verification of the
bootloader for ISO Functional Safety conformity. To proof correct behaviour in
the required environments I enabled the client to build an extensive unit test
suite in ANSI C (MISRA compatible).

### Building a Low Energy Microcontroller Bootloader (2015)

I joined this project from the beginning as a Consultant and Software Developer. The client wanted to build a new generation of Low Energy Microcontroller for Power Applications. To enable a satisfying user experience for engineers working with the chip, a versatile but extremely small and fast bootloader had to be development.

I focused on modern methodologies like Test Driven Development, Incremental
Design and Continuous Integration to build, test and release a tailored
Bootloader on Chip ROM with a specific aim towards zero defects.

### Fantasy Football Manager (2013/2014)

As a Lead Developer I was part of a Team of Software Developers to build a new
Fantasy Football Manager Platform in Ruby and Java. The development started
from a green field with the aim to deliver a fully functional and working
Fantasy Football game for millions of active users in about one year.

I helped to shape the product in close collaboration with the Product Owners
and Customers, while training new developers and leading the existing team
towards success. We used state of the art methodologies like Test Driven
Development and Continuous Integration to scale the complexity of the platform
while continuously delivering value.
