# Résumé: Jakob Holderbaum

I am a Freelance Consultant and Software Developer,
who is eager to help you and your team
to build successful products.
You can book me for software and hardware development and consulting, user centered product design, agile transformation and as a workshop facilitator.

## I am an Agile Enthusiast.

I spend my time **continuously delivering** software and hardware systems using
**test-first methodologies**. Working in close collaboration with fellow
developers, designers, business analysts and product owners by **pairing** and
**on-site teamwork** is a necessity to successfully realize a product vision.

## I am a Generalist.

Throughout the years I have faced challenges of product development in a
multitude of domains. With [neopoly][neopoly] I've developed **large scale
mobile browser games** entertaining millions of users. In addition to this I
worked on a wide spectrum of industry applications, from **security critical
IoT platforms** to **safety critical bootloaders for microcontrollers**.

## I am a Pragmatist.

I truly believe that picking the right tool for the job is much more valuable
than becoming a master of a single trade. Working with many different clients
and industries is enabling me to acquire a wide range of skills:

## Project References

### Fresh?? (2017/2018)

### Building an IoT Platform (2016/2017)

I designed and built an IoT Platform for connected machines. The project
consisted of development and maintenance of the embedded platform in the
machine, building a scalable cloud infrastructure to maintain the connection to
the vehicles and designing and delivering supportive software for end users.

The embedded software is built fully Test Driven and based on FreeRTOS and C++.
The cloud infrastructure is hosted on AWS, completely defned in code using
Terraform and Ruby. One focus of the infrastructure development was the
defnition in pure software combined with automated testing and continuous
deployment of the infrastructure.

The delivery itself was done with a mixed team of ThoughtWorkers and developers from 
the client. This involved a lot of mentoring and coaching to shape the agile way of 
working together towards an ambitious delivery goal.



### Building an App with Cloud Backend (2016)

I worked as a developing consultant with the client for several months on site.
The project consisted of a mobile HTML5 application written in React JS and a
Java/Spring backend that integrated with the Open Stack Cloud environment of
the clients infrastructure running Kubernetes.

The project consisted of two main focus points: Establishing a refined workkow
for the users of the application to replace the currently paper based process
and integration with the legacy CRM System and its SOAP Interfaces to provide a
consistent data representation and synchronization.  Technical concepts like
Docker Containerization, Continuous Integration & Release and XP Methodologies
like TDD and Pair Programming played a major role throughout the entire
development and maintenance efort.

Beside the technical delivery, the team also had an impact in shaping the clients workkow to help on the way towards a more agile approach to software delivery.
