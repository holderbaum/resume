# Profile of Jakob Holderbaum

I am a Freelance Consultant and Software Developer, who is eager to help you
and your team to build successful products.  You can book me for software and
hardware development and consulting, user centered product design, agile
transformation and as a workshop facilitator.

## I am an Agile Enthusiast.

I spend my time **continuously delivering** software and hardware systems using
**test-first methodologies**. Working in close collaboration with fellow
developers, designers, business analysts and product owners by **pairing** and
**on-site teamwork** is a necessity to successfully realize a product vision.

## I am a Generalist.

Throughout the years I have faced challenges of product development in a
multitude of domains. I've developed **large scale mobile browser games**
entertaining millions of users. In addition to this I worked on a wide spectrum
of industry applications, from **security critical IoT platforms** to **safety
critical bootloaders for microcontrollers**.

## I am a Pragmatist.

I truly believe that picking the right tool for the job is much more valuable
than becoming a master of a single trade. Working with many different clients
and industries is enabling me to acquire a wide range of skills:

## Project References

### Consulting for a Smart Meter IoT Platform (2017/2018)

I joined the company with an already existing platform that connects Smart
Meters and provides value added services for the customers, like live data on
mobile phone apps. Scope of the engagement was further development to help with
scaling issues, user centered design and an intensified focus on platform
security -- through co-delivery development and workshops on site.

The team was mixed between ThoughtWorks Consultants and Full Time Employees.

### Building an IoT Platform for Connected Machines (2016/2017)

I designed and built an IoT Platform for connected machines. The project
consisted of development and maintenance of the embedded platform in the
machine, building a scalable cloud infrastructure to maintain the connection to
the vehicles and designing and delivering supportive software for end users.

The embedded software is built fully Test Driven and based on FreeRTOS and C++.
The cloud infrastructure is hosted on AWS, completely defined in code using
Terraform and fully tested using Ruby. One focus of the development was the
definition in pure software combined with automated testing and continuous
deployment for the infrastructure.

The delivery itself was done with a mixed team of ThoughtWorkers and developers
from the client. This involved a lot of mentoring and coaching to shape the
agile way of working together towards an ambitious delivery goal.

### Building an App with Cloud Backend (2016)

I worked as a developing consultant with the client for several months on site.
The project consisted of a mobile HTML5 application written in React JS and a
Java/Spring backend that integrated with the Open Stack Cloud environment of
the clients infrastructure running Kubernetes.

The project consisted of two main focus points: Establishing a refined workkow
for the users of the application to replace the currently paper based process
and integration with the legacy CRM System and its SOAP Interfaces to provide a
consistent data representation and synchronization.  Technical concepts like
Docker Containerization, Continuous Integration & Release and XP Methodologies
like TDD and Pair Programming played a major role throughout the entire
development and maintenance efort.

Beside the technical delivery, the team also had an impact in shaping the clients workkow to help on the way towards a more agile approach to software delivery.

### Consulting for Automotive Microcontroller Bootloader Verification (2015)

The client I joined was pushing a new multicore automotive microcontroller to
market. A required part of the release was an automated verification of the
bootloader for ISO Functional Safety conformity. To proof correct behaviour in
the required environments I enabled the client to build an extensive unit test
suite in ANSI C (MISRA compatible).

### Building a Low Energy Microcontroller Bootloader (2015)

I joined this project from the beginning as a Consultant and Software Developer. The client wanted to build a new generation of Low Energy Microcontroller for Power Applications. To enable a satisfying user experience for engineers working with the chip, a versatile but extremely small and fast bootloader had to be development.

I focused on modern methodologies like Test Driven Development, Incremental
Design and Continuous Integration to build, test and release a tailored
Bootloader on Chip ROM with a specific aim towards zero defects.

### Fantasy Football Manager (2013/2014)

As a Lead Developer I was part of a Team of Software Developers to build a new
Fantasy Football Manager Platform in Ruby and Java. The development started
from a green field with the aim to deliver a fully functional and working
Fantasy Football game for millions of active users in about one year.

I helped to shape the product in close collaboration with the Product Owners
and Customers, while training new developers and leading the existing team
towards success. We used state of the art methodologies like Test Driven
Development and Continuous Integration to scale the complexity of the platform
while continuously delivering value.
